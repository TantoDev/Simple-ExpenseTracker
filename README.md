# Expense Tracker

A terminal-based expense tracker written in Python.

### Features
- Add expenses with a name and amount  
- View all added expenses  
- See total expenses  

### Why this exists
Just practicing.  
This is my second project after a basic calculator. I wanted to try something slightly more organized using classes.  

Nothing fancy â€” it works for now.

### Maybe later
- Error handling  
- File saving  
- Timestamps  
- GUI version?(maybeðŸ˜…)
