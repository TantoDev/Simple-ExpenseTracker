# Expense Tracker

A terminal-based expense tracker written in Python.

## Features
- Add expenses with a name and amount  
- View all added expenses  
- See total expenses  
- Delete an expense  
- Basic error handling  

## Background  
This is my second project after a basic calculator.  
I'm using it as a way to keep practicing â€” gradually adding new features, cleaning up the code, and learning better structure as I go.

## Updates  
- Delete option added  
- Error handling for invalid inputs  
- Cleaner and slightly more readable code  

## Maybe later  
- File saving  
- Timestamps  
- GUI version?
